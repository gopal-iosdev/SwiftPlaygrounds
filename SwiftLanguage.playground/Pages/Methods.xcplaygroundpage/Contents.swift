 NOTE:
    - Methods v/s Functions:
        - Methods: Functions that is associated to a type.
        - Functions: Chunks of code that do a specific task & not associated to a type.
        - All Methods are Functions, but not vice versa.
    - Structures and enumerations are value types. By default, the properties of a value type can’t be modified from within its instance methods.
        - Use `mutating` before instance functions to modify the values.
    - In Objective-C, you can define type-level methods only for Objective-C classes. In Swift, you can define type-level methods for all classes, structures, and enumerations. Each type method is explicitly scoped to the type it supports.
 
 - Methods:
    - Methods are functions that are associated with a particular type.
    - Classes, structures, and enumerations can all define instance methods, which encapsulate specific tasks and functionality for working with an instance of a given type.
 
 - Instance Methods:
    - Instance methods are functions that belong to instances of a particular class, structure, or enumeration.

 - Type Methods:
    - Define methods that are called on the type itself.
    - You indicate type methods by writing the static keyword before the method’s func keyword.
    - Classes can use the class keyword instead, to allow subclasses to override the superclass’s implementation of that method.
    - A type method can call another type method with the other method’s name, without needing to prefix it with the type name.
