 - Multiline Strings:
    - When you don‚Äôt want the line breaks to be part of the string‚Äôs value, Write a backslash (\) at the end of those lines.
        Example:
        1.) let quotation = """
             The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
             please your Majesty?" he asked.
             """
            print(quotation):
             The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
             please your Majesty?" he asked.
        2.) let softWrappedQuotation = """
             The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
             please your Majesty?" he asked.
            """
            print(softWrappedQuotation):
             The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?" he asked.
- Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type.
- Unicode:
    - Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems.
    - Swift‚Äôs String and Character types are fully Unicode-compliant.
 
- String Indices:
    - Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string.
    - startIndex property to access the position of the first Character of a String.
    - endIndex property is the position after the last character in a String.
        - As a result, the endIndex property isn‚Äôt a valid argument to a string‚Äôs subscript
    - If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.
 
    - NOTE:
        - You can use the startIndex and endIndex properties and the index(before:), index(after:), and index(_:offsetBy:) methods on any type that conforms to the Collection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.
 - Note:
    - You can use the insert(_:at:), insert(contentsOf:at:), remove(at:), and removeSubrange(_:) methods on any type that conforms to the RangeReplaceableCollection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.
 
 - Substrings:
    - substring from a string.
    - Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings.
    - However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string.
    - The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring.
    - substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string.
    - Note:
        - Both String and Substring conform to the StringProtocol protocol, which means it‚Äôs often convenient for string-manipulation functions to accept a StringProtocol value. You can call such functions with either a String or Substring value.
 - Comparing Strings:
    - Two String values (or two Character values) are considered equal if their extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent.
        - Grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent if they have the same linguistic meaning and appearance
        - Grapheme Cluster:
            - Every instance of Swift‚Äôs Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.
    - NOTE:
        - String and character comparisons in Swift aren‚Äôt locale-sensitive.
 
 - Prefix and Suffix Equality:
    - To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.
    - NOTE:
        - The hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods perform a character-by-character canonical equivalence comparison between the extended grapheme clusters in each string
